#Simple web notepad

##What is it?

It's a very simple web based notepad which allows you to save text information. It saves the data to a file rather than to a database for simplicity and it uses tinyMCE as the editor.
  
##What is the point of it?

It allows you to save urls etc... on your own personal notepad on the web. You have to enter a password to edit it so only you can change what is stored. It's great for quickly transfering urls and other settings between computers.
  
##Installation

Installation is really simple, just copy the files onto a webserver running php and change the password at the top of the index.php file. Default password is 'password'.
